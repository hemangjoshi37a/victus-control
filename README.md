# victus-control

**Fan control and keyboard lighting for HP Victus / Omen laptops on Linux.**

Stock firmware parks both fans near **2000 RPM** in AUTO while the CPU cooks.
`victus-control` gives you a real fan curve, animated RGB backlighting, a
privileged backend, a GTK4 desktop app, and a GNOME Shell extension.

## Why victus-control

| | Feature | What it does |
| :-: | --- | --- |
| 🌀 | **Better Auto** | Samples CPU/GPU temperature and utilisation every ~2 s, clamps to each fan's hardware maximum, and reapplies targets every 90 s with the firmware-required 10 s stagger. Fans climb smoothly with load instead of idling at 2000 RPM like HP's AUTO. |
| 🎚️ | **Manual mode** | Eight RPM steps (~2000 ➜ 5800/6100 RPM) with per-fan precision and watchdog refreshes that keep settings alive through firmware quirks. |
| 🌈 | **Animated lighting** | Single-zone and four-zone RGB, brightness, and rainbow / breathe / flow animations that keep running after the app is closed. |
| 📊 | **Analog telemetry** | Fan dials whose blades turn with the real RPM, and thermometers that shift colour as they heat. |
| 🖥️ | **GNOME integration** | Fan and keyboard controls from the top panel. |

> [!WARNING]
> Validated primarily on **HP Victus 16-s00xxxx** and contributor-tested on the Fedora/Arch variants listed in PRs and issues. Other models may work but are not guaranteed — **monitor your thermals**. On **HP Victus 15 fa0xxx**, manual fan speeds appear unsupported; only `MAX`, `AUTO`, and Better Auto are known to behave.

---

## Quick install

> [!NOTE]
> **Two builds exist.** This repository is a fork of
> [Batuhan4/victus-control](https://github.com/Batuhan4/victus-control) by
> [@Batuhan4](https://github.com/Batuhan4), who wrote the original project.
> The additions here — animated lighting, the single-page dashboard, and the
> fan-control escape hatch — are open upstream as
> [#23](https://github.com/Batuhan4/victus-control/pull/23),
> [#24](https://github.com/Batuhan4/victus-control/pull/24) and
> [#25](https://github.com/Batuhan4/victus-control/pull/25). Once they are
> merged, install upstream and ignore this fork.

**This fork** — upstream plus the features above:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hemangjoshi37a/victus-control/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

**Upstream** — the original project, without the additions:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Batuhan4/victus-control/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

Either script downloads that repository's current `main` into a temporary directory and runs `install.sh`. Each defaults to the repository it was fetched from, so the command you run is the build you get.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do **not** pipe either into `sudo`. `install.sh` elevates itself and needs to know the original desktop user to set up the GNOME extension.

---

## Support matrix

| Component | Status |
| --- | --- |
| **Main installer** | Arch-based, Fedora, and Ubuntu/Debian-based distros |
| **Desktop app** | GTK4, installed by the main project installer |
| **GNOME Shell extension** | GNOME Shell 45+, auto-installed by `install.sh` when GNOME is present |
| **Ubuntu / Debian** | Contributor-tested on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (GNOME 46); other Debian-based distros use the same path but are less tested |

---

## Secure Boot / userspace alternative

If you can't load the patched `hp-wmi` DKMS module — most notably on **Ubuntu with Secure Boot enabled**, where unsigned out-of-tree modules are rejected — see [`victus-fan/`](victus-fan/).

It is a self-contained **userspace** controller that drives the **stock** in-tree `hp-wmi` driver (two-state `pwm1_enable`, no kernel module), tying fan speed to your power profile and CPU / iGPU / NVIDIA temperature via a small daemon + CLI (no GUI). Tested on an HP Victus 15-fb0xxx running Ubuntu 26.04 — see [`victus-fan/README.md`](victus-fan/README.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Pick one fan controller, not both.** `victus-fan` and the main `victus-backend` both write the same `pwm1_enable` knob; running both at once makes them fight over the fans. Use `victus-fan` **instead of** the DKMS stack on machines where the patched module can't load — not alongside it.

---

## System requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| OS | 64-bit Linux with `systemd` |
| Package manager | `pacman` (Arch), `dnf` (Fedora), or `apt-get` (Ubuntu/Debian) |
| Desktop | GNOME Shell 45+ for the panel extension (optional) |
| Privileges | Root, for the DKMS module, sudoers rules, and systemd units |

---

## Install & update

### Bootstrap one-liner

This fork:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hemangjoshi37a/victus-control/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

Upstream:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Batuhan4/victus-control/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

Use either if you want a temporary checkout and the shortest install path.

`bootstrap.sh` installs from whichever repository you fetched it from. To point one at the other explicitly, set `VICTUS_CONTROL_REPO_URL`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hemangjoshi37a/victus-control/main/bootstrap.sh | \
  VICTUS_CONTROL_REPO_URL=https://github.com/Batuhan4/victus-control bash
```

`VICTUS_CONTROL_REF` selects a branch or tag if you want something other than `main`.

### Git clone installer

This fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hemangjoshi37a/victus-control.git
cd victus-control
sudo ./install.sh
```

Upstream:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Batuhan4/victus-control.git
cd victus-control
sudo ./install.sh
```

The wrapper routes to `arch-install.sh`, `fedora-install.sh`, or `ubuntu-install.sh` based on your OS. On GNOME systems it also installs the panel extension for the desktop user automatically.

The installer handles dependency install, user/group creation, DKMS module registration, build + install, and restarts `victus-backend.service`.

> [!NOTE]
> Log out and back in afterwards so your user joins the `victus` group.

### Fedora notes

- Validated by contributors on `HP Victus 16-S0046NT` with Fedora 43.
- The Fedora installer verifies that the patched `hp_wmi` module is actually active before starting the backend.
- If you recently updated the kernel, reboot first so the running kernel matches the installed `kernel-devel` package.

### Ubuntu / Debian notes

- Contributor-tested on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (GNOME 46) with an HP Victus 16.
- The installer accepts DKMS-managed `hp_wmi` module layouts used by both `/extra` and `/updates/dkms`.
- Secure Boot can block the DKMS module from loading. If install succeeds but `hp_wmi` still does not load, enroll the MOK key with `sudo mokutil --import /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der` or disable Secure Boot, then reboot.

### Background services

| Unit | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `victus-healthcheck.service` | Runs at boot to ensure the patched `hp-wmi` DKMS module is built for the current kernel and `hp_wmi` is loaded before the backend starts |
| `victus-backend.service` | Starts at boot and stays active, keeping Better Auto and the lighting applied even with no UI client connected |

---

## Daily usage

Launch the GTK app (`victus-control`) or use the CLI client (`test_backend.py`).

Everything lives on one page, with a card per subsystem.

**Cooling card** — the profile dropdown offers `AUTO`, `Better Auto`, `MANUAL`, `MAX`:

- *Better Auto* is enforced by the background service on each boot, keeps fans in manual PWM, and adjusts RPM from temperature and utilisation — ideal for gaming or heavy workloads.
- *Manual* maps slider positions to calibrated RPM steps; fan 2 honours the 10 s offset automatically.

Fan speed and temperature are shown as analog dials with the digital value under each. The rotor blades turn at a rate derived from the measured RPM, and a stopped fan renders grey rather than merely still. Thermometers and readouts shift cyan → amber → red, crossing at 70 °C and 85 °C.

> [!NOTE]
> On boards whose firmware refuses fan speed targets, manual speed is removed from the card entirely and `MANUAL` is dropped from the profile list, rather than being offered as a control that does nothing.

**Keyboard card** — a switch turns the backlight on and off, a row of style radios picks the lighting mode, and the speed slider or colour picker appears depending on which style is selected. There is no Apply step; changing anything applies it.

Backend status: `systemctl status victus-backend.service` (logs via `journalctl -u victus-backend`).

---

## Lighting effects

| Effect | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| **Static colour** | One fixed colour — the classic behaviour |
| **Rainbow cycle** | The whole keyboard walks the hue wheel |
| **Breathe** | The current colour fades in and out |
| **Flow (river)** | On four-zone Omen keyboards the hue travels left-to-right across the zones, so the colour flows along the board. Not offered on single-zone hardware, which has no geometry for it |

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/images/screenshot-solid.png" width="560" alt="Solid style showing the colour picker">
<br>
<em>Picking <b>Solid</b> swaps the speed slider for a colour picker — the card only shows the control that applies.</em>
</div>

- The **Speed** slider (1–100) sets the cycle rate.
- Picking a static colour stops the animation, and the chosen effect is restored after a reboot.
- The animation runs in the backend, so lighting keeps going after the GUI is closed. It pauses while the backlight is switched off.

> [!TIP]
> Controls that cannot do anything are not shown: **Flow** is absent on single-zone boards, the colour picker only appears for **Solid**, and the speed slider only for the animated styles.

## GNOME Shell extension

Quick access to fan and keyboard controls from the top panel.

| | Feature |
| :-: | --- |
| 🌀 | **Fan mode control** — AUTO, Better Auto, MANUAL, MAX |
| 📊 | **Manual fan speed** — per-fan sliders with 8 RPM steps (visible in MANUAL mode) |
| ⌨️ | **Keyboard RGB** — 10 colour presets and a brightness slider |
| 🌡️ | **Live status** — real-time CPU temperature and fan RPM |

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
gnome-extensions enable victus-control@victus
```

`install.sh` installs the extension automatically on GNOME systems. You only need the manual `gnome-extensions enable ...` step after install or after logging back in.

<details>
<summary>Install the extension by itself</summary>

```bash
cd gnome-extension
bash ./install.sh
gnome-extensions enable victus-control@victus
```

</details>

**Requirements:** GNOME Shell 45+, `victus-backend.service` running. On Ubuntu GNOME and other GNOME desktops the extension can be installed separately as long as the backend socket is available.

See [gnome-extension/README.md](gnome-extension/README.md) for detailed documentation.

---

## Developing

```bash
meson setup build --prefix=/usr
meson compile -C build
sudo meson install -C build
```

- Smoke test (requires the backend running): `python test_backend.py`
- The installer fetches `hp-wmi-fan-and-backlight-control`; it is git-ignored to keep the repo lean.

---

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Fans ignore commands</b></summary>

Ensure the DKMS module is loaded:

```bash
dkms status | grep hp-wmi-fan-and-backlight-control
modprobe --show-depends hp_wmi | tail -n1
```

The last command should point at the DKMS-built `hp-wmi.ko` under `/updates/dkms/` on Arch or `/extra/` on other distros.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Fans stuck at one speed after the service starts</b></summary>

A few boards report software fan support but have a BIOS that ignores per-RPM targets. Better Auto then switches the fans to MANUAL and cannot set a speed, leaving them pinned with the firmware curve disabled.

Check with:

```bash
cat /sys/devices/platform/hp-wmi/hwmon/hwmon*/fan1_target
```

If that returns `Invalid argument` while writes appear to succeed, your board is affected. Keep the keyboard lighting and leave the fans to the firmware:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/victus-backend.service.d
printf '[Service]\nEnvironment=VICTUS_NO_FAN_CONTROL=1\n' | \
  sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/victus-backend.service.d/no-fan-control.conf
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart victus-backend
```

The app detects this case and disables the manual speed slider with an explanation rather than letting it fail silently.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Permission errors</b></summary>

Confirm `victus` group membership, then re-run the installer:

```bash
groups $USER
sudo usermod -aG victus $USER
```

Log out and back in for the group change to take effect.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Socket missing</b></summary>

```bash
sudo systemd-tmpfiles --create
sudo systemctl restart victus-backend.service
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>GNOME extension missing after install</b></summary>

Log out and back in once, then:

```bash
gnome-extensions enable victus-control@victus
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Uninstall</b></summary>

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now victus-backend
sudo dkms remove hp-wmi-fan-and-backlight-control/$(dkms status -m hp-wmi-fan-and-backlight-control | sed -n 's#.*/\([^,]*\),.*#\1#p' | head -n1) --all
```

Substitute the version shown by `dkms status` if the command above does not resolve it.

</details>
